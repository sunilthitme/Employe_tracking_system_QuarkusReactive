Why Sessions:

Grouping Operations:

Think of a session like a container for multiple actions you want to perform on a database. It helps group these actions together.
Safety Net:

Imagine you're doing several things at once (like updating different parts of a database). A session acts like a safety net. If anything goes wrong with any of those things, you can "undo" everything and keep the database in a safe state.
Avoiding Chaos:

It's like cooking a complicated dish. You prepare all the ingredients, cook them together, and if something burns or goes wrong, you don't serve the dish. The same idea applies to database actions within a session.
Why in a Reactive Environment (Mutiny):

Reactive Nature:

In a reactive world, where things happen in a non-blocking way, sessions help you manage multiple actions happening at the same time.
Error Handling:

Sessions help you deal with problems smoothly. If anything fails during your planned actions (like saving data), the session helps you handle those errors in a neat way.
Efficient Resource Use:

Imagine you're borrowing tools to fix something. A session helps you "borrow" and "return" resources (like a database connection) efficiently, without wasting them.
Keeping Things in Order:

When different parts of your program want to talk to the database, sessions help ensure that everyone takes turns and doesn't create chaos.
So, in simple terms, sessions are like containers for database actions. They keep things organized, safe, and manageable, especially in the fast-paced world of reactive programming using Mutiny.
